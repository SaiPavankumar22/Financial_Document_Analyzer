## Financial Document Analyzer â€“ Debug Report (What I Found and Fixed)

### Why this report
I audited the codebase end-to-end, identified breaking issues and risky patterns, and implemented a clean, working path that uses OpenAI for LLM calls and a local PDF parser. Below I explain the problems I found and exactly what I changed, file by file, plus how to run the app.

### Environment assumptions
- I use OpenAI via an environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- For web search functionality, `SERPER_API_KEY` is also required

---

### Summary of major problems (before my changes)
- No valid LLM configuration; `llm = llm` caused a runtime error.
- Agents were configured with questionable prompts and a wrong parameter name (`tool` instead of `tools`).
- Tasks encouraged hallucinations, fake URLs, and did not consume the uploaded document.
- The PDF tool used an undefined `Pdf` class and mixed async usage in a way that didn't fit the flow.
- API kicked off the crew without passing the actual file contents; `file_path` was ignored in the crew inputs.
- README install command had a filename typo, and `pypdf` was missing from dependencies.

---

### What I changed (by file)

#### `agents.py` - SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED (latest)
- Configured OpenAI LLM using `crewai.LLM` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Transformed from basic agents to a comprehensive multi-agent system with specialized roles:
  - `financial_analyst`: CFA-certified analyst with file reading, PDF search, and CSV analysis tools
  - `document_verifier`: Specialized in document verification and data integrity
  - `investment_advisor`: Investment products advisor with web search capabilities
  - `risk_assessor`: Risk and compliance specialist
- Added tool integration using `crewai_tools` (FileReadTool, PDFSearchTool, CSVSearchTool, SerperDevTool, WebsiteSearchTool).
- Set up environment variable handling for `SERPER_API_KEY`.
- Configured each agent with appropriate tools, professional backstories, and `max_iter`/`max_rpm` for stability.

Why: The original setup would crash (undefined `llm`) and the prompts encouraged unsafe output. I replaced this with a production-ready multi-agent system that can handle complex financial analysis workflows.

Key snippet after change:
```python
llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)

financial_analyst = Agent(
    role="Senior Financial Data Analyst",
    tools=[file_reader, pdf_search, csv_search],
    llm=llm,
    max_iter=3,
    max_rpm=3,
    allow_delegation=True
)
```

#### `task.py` - COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURED (latest)
- **MAJOR IMPROVEMENT**: Replaced single task with a sophisticated multi-task workflow:
  - `verification`: Document verification and data extraction task
  - `analyze_financial_document`: Main financial analysis task with context from verification
  - `investment_analysis`: Investment recommendations task with context from analysis
  - `risk_assessment`: Risk assessment task with context from both analysis and investment tasks
- Implemented task dependencies using `context=[...]` for proper workflow sequencing.
- Added tool integration (custom `FinancialDocumentTool` wrapper and `search_tool`).
- Created structured, professional task descriptions with clear expected outputs.

Why: Tasks must use the actual PDF content passed from the API to produce relevant analysis. The new workflow ensures proper data flow and comprehensive analysis.

#### `main.py` - ENHANCED WITH ERROR HANDLING (latest)
- Added `_extract_pdf_text` using `pypdf.PdfReader` to convert the uploaded PDF to text safely.
- Added PDF text validation - returns HTTP 400 if PDF contains no readable text.
- Added `asyncio.to_thread()` for proper async handling of crew execution.
- Updated `run_crew(query, document_text)` to pass both inputs to the crew.
- Updated the `/analyze` endpoint with better error handling and validation.

Why: Previously, the crew never saw the uploaded document content; now the analysis is grounded in the PDF with proper async handling and validation.

#### `tools.py` - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN (latest)
- Replaced broken tools with a comprehensive tool system:
  - `_FinancialDocumentTool`: Proper BaseTool implementation with Pydantic schema
  - `analyze_investment_tool`: Structured investment analysis tool with template output
  - `create_risk_assessment_tool`: Risk assessment tool with comprehensive risk categories
  - `FinancialDocumentTool`: Compatibility wrapper for existing code
- Added proper error handling and input validation.
- Integrated with LangChain's PyPDFLoader for reliable PDF processing; provided a compatibility wrapper `FinancialDocumentTool.read_data_tool`.
- Created structured output templates for consistent analysis results.

Why: The PDF read is now done with proper tool architecture, error handling, and structured outputs that integrate well with the CrewAI workflow.

#### `requirements.txt` (latest)
- Pinned CrewAI to `0.130.0` and `crewai-tools` to `0.47.1`.
- Updated OpenTelemetry packages to >= 1.30.0/0.50b0 for compatibility.
- Upgraded `openai` to `1.73.0`.
- Upgraded `pydantic` to `2.11.7` and `pydantic-core` to `2.33.2`.
- Kept `pypdf==4.3.1` for PDF extraction.

#### `README.md`
- Fixed the install command typo: `requirements.txt`.
- Minor wording fix ("You're All Set!").

### How it works now (enhanced workflow)
1. Client calls `POST /analyze` with a PDF and an optional `query`.
2. API saves the file and extracts text with `pypdf`, validates text content.
3. Crew runs a sophisticated multi-task workflow:
   - **Verification**: Document verification and data extraction
   - **Analysis**: Financial analysis with verification context
   - **Investment**: Investment recommendations with analysis context
   - **Risk Assessment**: Risk assessment with full context
4. Response is returned; the uploaded file is cleaned up.

---

### How to run
1. Create `.env` with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_key_here
```
2. Install deps:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start API:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
4. Test:
  - POST `http://localhost:8000/analyze` with form-data:
    - `file`: your PDF
    - `query`: e.g., "Analyze this financial document for investment insights"

---

### Notes and next steps (if we iterate)
- The system now supports comprehensive financial analysis with multiple specialized agents.
- Consider adding streaming responses for long-running analyses.
- Add unit tests for the enhanced tool system and multi-task workflow.
- Consider adding caching for repeated document analyses.

---

### Final status
I validated that the code imports cleanly, lints without errors, and the service runs with the enhanced pipeline. The system now provides comprehensive, multi-agent financial analysis of uploaded documents using OpenAI, with proper error handling, validation, and structured outputs.
