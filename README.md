# Financial Document Analyzer - Debug Assignment

## Project Overview
A comprehensive financial document analysis system that processes corporate reports, financial statements, and investment documents using AI-powered analysis agents.

## Getting Started

### Install Required Libraries
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_key_here
```

## Usage
1. Start the API server:
```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
2. After running the command, wait about 1 minute for background initializations.
3. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to use the interactive Swagger UI.
   - Upload a PDF and provide an optional query to test the analysis pipeline.
4. All background executions and logs will be visible in your terminal.

### Sample Document
The system analyzes financial documents like Tesla's Q2 2025 financial update.

**To add Tesla's financial document:**
1. Download the Tesla Q2 2025 update from: https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/TSLA-Q2-2025-Update.pdf
2. Save it as `data/sample.pdf` in the project directory
3. Or upload any financial PDF through the API endpoint

**Note:** Current `data/sample.pdf` is a placeholder - replace with actual Tesla financial document for proper testing.
